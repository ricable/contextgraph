# PRD 01: CaseTrack Overview

## One-Click Legal Document Analysis for Claude Code & Claude Desktop

**Version**: 4.0.0
**Date**: 2026-01-28
**Status**: Draft
**Scope**: Fresh greenfield project build
**Language**: Rust (entire project -- no exceptions)

> **BUILD MANDATE**: CaseTrack is built entirely in Rust. The binary crate, core
> library, MCP server, document processing, embedding engine, storage layer,
> search engine, license validation, CLI, and all tooling are Rust. The only
> non-Rust code is a Python helper script for one-time ONNX model conversion
> (a build-time tool, not shipped to users). There is no JavaScript, TypeScript,
> Python, Go, or C++ in the product. All dependencies are Rust crates. The
> output is a single statically-linked Rust binary with zero runtime dependencies.

## 1. What is CaseTrack?

CaseTrack is a **one-click installable MCP server** that plugs into **Claude Code** and **Claude Desktop**, giving Claude the ability to ingest, search, and analyze legal documents. Everything runs on the user's machine -- **all embeddings, vectors, and databases are stored locally** on the user's device with zero cloud dependencies.

## 2. The Problem

Legal professionals waste hours searching through case documents:

- **Keyword search fails**: "breach of duty" won't find "violation of fiduciary obligation"
- **No AI integration**: Can't ask questions about documents in natural language
- **No provenance**: When you find something, you can't cite the exact source
- **Complex tools**: Existing legal tech requires IT departments and training
- **Expensive**: Enterprise legal tech costs $200-500+/seat/month

---

## 3. The Solution

CaseTrack solves this with:

1. **One-click install**: Single command or MCPB file -- embedders and database included
2. **100% local storage**: All embeddings and vectors stored on YOUR device in RocksDB
3. **7 specialized embedders**: Semantic search that understands legal language
4. **Full provenance**: Every answer cites document, page, paragraph, line
5. **Claude Code + Desktop integration**: Works with both Claude Code CLI and Claude Desktop app
6. **Runs anywhere**: Works on an 8GB MacBook Air, no GPU needed
7. **Affordable**: Free tier is genuinely useful; Pro is $29/month

---

## 4. Key Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Install time | < 2 minutes |
| First search after install | < 5 minutes |
| Search latency | < 200ms on any laptop |
| PDF ingestion | < 1 second per page |
| RAM usage | < 2GB peak |
| Model download | ~400MB one-time |

---

## 5. Vision Statement

> **Any attorney can ask Claude questions about their case documents and get accurate, cited answers -- without IT support, cloud accounts, or technical knowledge.**

---

## 6. Design Principles

```
DESIGN PRINCIPLES
=================================================================================

1. ZERO CONFIGURATION
   User downloads file -> double-clicks -> starts using
   No terminal, no config files, no environment variables
   Claude Code: single curl command + one settings.json entry

2. RUNS ON ANYTHING
   8GB RAM laptop from 2020 should work fine
   No GPU required, ever
   Intel, AMD, Apple Silicon all supported

3. PRIVACY FIRST
   Documents never leave the device
   No telemetry, no analytics, no cloud
   Attorney-client privilege preserved
   License validation works offline after first activation

4. INSTANT VALUE
   First useful search within 5 minutes of download
   No training required
   Works like asking a research assistant

5. PROVENANCE ALWAYS
   Every answer includes exact source citation
   Document name, page, paragraph, line number
   One click to view original context

6. GRACEFUL DEGRADATION
   Low RAM? Use fewer models (lazy loading)
   Slow CPU? Longer ingestion, same quality
   Free tier? Fewer features, still useful

7. FAIL LOUDLY
   Errors are specific and actionable
   No silent failures -- every operation reports success or explains failure
   MCP error responses include recovery instructions
```

---

## 7. What CaseTrack is NOT

- **Not a document management system**: Use Dropbox/OneDrive for storage
- **Not a practice management tool**: No billing, calendaring, or client management
- **Not e-discovery software**: Not built for litigation holds or productions
- **Not a cloud service**: Everything runs locally, we never see your data
- **Not an LLM**: CaseTrack provides tools to Claude; it does not generate answers itself
