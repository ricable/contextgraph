//! Storage module for embeddings.
//!
//! This module is a placeholder for Multi-Array Storage implementations.
//!
//! Storage implementations should use SemanticFingerprint or JohariFingerprint
//! from the context-graph-teleology crate. Each embedding is stored SEPARATELY
//! at its native dimension for per-space indexing.
