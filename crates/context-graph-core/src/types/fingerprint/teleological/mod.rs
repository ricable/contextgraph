//! TeleologicalFingerprint: Complete node representation with purpose-aware metadata.
//!
//! This is the top-level fingerprint type that wraps SemanticFingerprint with:
//! - Purpose Vector (13D alignment to North Star goal)
//! - Johari Fingerprint (per-embedder awareness classification)
//! - Purpose Evolution (time-series of alignment changes)
//!
//! Enables goal-aligned retrieval: "find memories similar to X that serve the same purpose"
