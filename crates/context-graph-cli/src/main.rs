//! Context Graph CLI
//!
//! CLI tools for Context Graph memory management and hooks integration.
//!
//! # Commands
//!
//! - `session restore-identity`: Restore session state from storage
//! - `session persist-identity`: Persist session state to storage
//! - `hooks`: Claude Code native hooks commands
//! - `memory`: Memory capture and context injection commands
//! - `warmup`: Pre-load embedding models into VRAM
//!
//! This CLI provides hooks integration for Claude Code via .claude/settings.json.
//! NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY - FAIL FAST WITH ROBUST LOGGING.
//!
//! # Constitution Reference
//! - ARCH-07: Native Claude Code hooks
//! - ARCH-08: CUDA GPU required for production
//! - AP-26: Exit code 1 on error, 2 on corruption
